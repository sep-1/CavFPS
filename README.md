# First Person Shooter Interface
An FPS written in Lua with Roblox's API.
I wrote this program early in high school after being inspired by a video game character and updated it infrequently. 
Looking back, I am glad to see improvement in my skills as a programmer.
Given that this project was written on the Roblox Studio IDE, the code is best run there.
You can do this by running the .rbxl file on Roblox studio.
The other files in this repository are the individual scripts that make up the project.

This program gives the player a first person interface complete with a functional weapon that is able to be fired, aimed and reloaded. 
When it comes to firing, there is a completely randomized hip fire algorithm, along with a more accurate aiming option if you hold down the right mouse button.
