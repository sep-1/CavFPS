# CavFPS
An FPS written in Lua with Roblox's API.
I wrote this program early in high school and updated it infrequently. 
Looking back, I am glad to see improvement in my skills as a programmer.
Given that this project was written on the Roblox Studio IDE, the code is best run there.
You can do this by running the .rbxl file on Roblox studio.
The other files in this repository are the individual scripts that make up the project.
